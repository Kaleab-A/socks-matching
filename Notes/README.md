# Notes

## 1. &nbsp; How to get the training and testing images

### Issues

- Find training data online, then they might not be as realistic as the real time picture. Then the model does well on training but not on real time.
- Take pictures of socks. This is more realistic, but it is time consuming. And I only have black socks.

### Solutions

- Take image from online and also take pictures of socks. Then combine them together.
