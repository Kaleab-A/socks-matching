# socks-matching
Machine Learning Project, given two image of socks, determine if they are pairs or not

1. Data Collection and Preprocessing
Collect a Diverse Dataset: Gather images of socks, ensuring a wide variety of colors, patterns, and styles. Both individual and paired socks should be included.
Image Preprocessing: Standardize the images by resizing them to a uniform size. Normalize the pixel values (e.g., scale them to a range of 0 to 1).
Image Segmentation: Optionally, segment the socks from the background if the images have varied backgrounds. This can be done using techniques like thresholding or contour detection.
2. Feature Extraction
Color Features: Extract color histograms or compute dominant color features. This can be done by converting images to a color space like HSV and calculating histograms for each channel.
Texture Features: Analyze the texture using methods like Gabor filters or Local Binary Patterns (LBP). This helps in recognizing patterns like stripes or dots.
Shape Features: Extract shape-related features if there are noticeable differences in shapes or sizes of socks.
3. Machine Learning Model
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN): Train a CNN to learn discriminating features of the socks. You don't necessarily need to classify each sock; instead, the goal is to get a feature representation.
Siamese Network (Optional): If using a Siamese network, design it to take two images as input and output a similarity score. The network learns to distinguish between similar and dissimilar pairs.
4. Matching Socks
Feature Comparison: For a simpler approach without deep learning, directly compare the extracted features (color, texture, shape) of two sock images using a similarity measure (like Euclidean distance).
Using CNN Features: If using a CNN, extract feature vectors from a deep layer of the network for each sock image. Then, calculate the similarity between these vectors for different socks.
Thresholding: Set a threshold for similarity. If the similarity score is above this threshold, classify the socks as a pair.
5. Evaluation
Test with Unseen Data: Use a separate set of images to evaluate the algorithmâ€™s performance.
Metrics: Calculate accuracy, precision, and recall to understand how well your algorithm is performing.
6. Refinement
Hyperparameter Tuning: Adjust the parameters of your machine learning model or feature extraction process.
Data Augmentation: To improve the model's robustness, augment your data with transformations like rotations and color shifts.
7. Deployment
Interface Development: Develop a user interface where users can upload images of socks to find matches.
Integration: Integrate your machine learning model with the interface for real-time processing.
Challenges and Tips
Varied Lighting and Angles: Socks in different lighting or angles can appear different. Data augmentation can help mitigate this.
Pattern Complexity: Some socks may have complex patterns that are hard to match. In such cases, increasing the depth and complexity of the CNN might help.
Computation Time: For large datasets, consider the time it takes to compare features. Efficient algorithms for comparison and feature extraction are key
